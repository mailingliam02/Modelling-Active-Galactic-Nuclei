The swco.dat file is used by the 'barycorr' tool to correct Swift
times for the measured clock offset (based on data provided by the
Swift MOC). This is an ascii file with identical structure to the RXTE
file 'tdc.dat' used by various RXTE-specific tools. The columns contain
polynomial coefficients for various time ranges and are used to compute
the appropriate clock correction for any given mission elapsed time
(since launch).

In contrast to RXTE where these fine clock corrections have magnitudes
typically measured in the tens of microseconds, the Swift corrections
are much larger (0.6-0.7 seconds currently) and more regular. At this
writing (March 2005) the spacecraft clock lags behind reference clocks
on the ground but also runs fast.  The current trend is for the clock
to slowly accelerate.
