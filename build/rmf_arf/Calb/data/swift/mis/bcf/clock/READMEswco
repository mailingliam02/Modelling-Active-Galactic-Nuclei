Swift/MIS CalDB 20050805 Release Notes
========================================================================

Update 2005-08-05

   The clock correction file used by 'swifttime' and 'barycorr' has 
   been changed to FITS format and is now stored in CALDB. 
   With the Swift software release 2.1 (Heasoft 6.0.2, August 2005), 
   the default behavior of both tools has been modified to retrieve the
   FITS version of the clock correction file from the CALDB. 
   The old ascii formatted file 'swco.dat' circulated up to now is still
   supported however new clock correction updates will be added only to the 
   FITS version of the file.
   The latest version of the 'swco.dat' is valid till June 2005.   

   The FITS correction file will be updated quickly on about a bi-weekly 
   schedule, it is recommended to users to always check out from CALDB 
   the latest version of the file or set CALDB with the remote access. 
   The latest version version of the file is at 
     ftp://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/caldb/data/swift/mis/bcf/clock/

   named as 
    swclockcor20041120vNNN.fits 

   where NNN is the version number. Use always the higher version
