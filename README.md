# Modelling Active Galatic Nuclei using XSPEC and Neural Networks
## Introduction
This is a repository containing the python files used in the "Modelling an Active Galactic Nuclei using a Neural Network" paper (see docs for full paper pdf). The purpose of the project was to train a neural network on simulated active galactic nuclei (AGN) spectras to predict key components of the black hole like accretion rate and mass. This neural network would then be generalized to real active galactic nuclei.
